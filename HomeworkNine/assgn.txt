Its just average

Create an application that:

Takes in a list of comma-separated numbers from the user
Splits that list into an array of numbers
Converts the string version of the numbers into number versions
Loops through the array and sums up the values
Calculates the average of the array
Displays to the user
The average
The sum
Removes the text from the input so the user can type in new numbers
 

Bad word catcher with loops

 

For the purposes of this exercise, bad words are: clear, water, tires.

Create an application that:

Takes input from a user using a simple text input field.
Splits the string on spaces
Loops through  the array looking for bad words in the array
Adds 1 to a tally count when a bad word is found
Outputs to the document
If any bad words were found (found / not found)
How many bad words, in total, were found
Clears out the text field so the user can input a new string
 

For example, if the user input "clear water is clear", there are 3 bad words in the string.

 

Bad word catcher with array methods

Recreate the above exercise, but using the array.find and array.includes methods.

 

Make Divs

Given the array

let objects = [

 { color: "#FF0000", height: 100, width: 300 },

 { color: "#FFFF00", height: 200, width: 200 },

 { color: "#ff0000", height: 300, width: 100 },

];

Write a loop that creates three divs based on the data in the array. You should only have one document.createElement in your code.
