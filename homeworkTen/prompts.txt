1. Color Changer

Create an application with three grey, square divs, in a row. They should be 200px by 200px, and all floated left. Give them a margin of 5px.

Using only one event handler, write event listeners to respond to a click on each element. Each element should change to a different color: one red, one green, and one blue. Use a data attribute on the elements to store the color to be changed to.

2. Color Mixer

 

This is an application that will start a div at a black color, and as a user presses buttons associated with RGB, the div will change to new colors. The button presses should affect additively - that is. If a div is currently blue, pressing +red buttons will change the div to a purple color.

9 buttons (associated with red green and blue). There should be a +1, +5, and +10 button for each color.
1 div that will change colors to the rgb color calculated

1 div that shows the current calculated rgb color

You must use attributes on the buttons for the values to change the colors by.



3: Flash Cards

An application with 3 buttons that ask questions. For instance, they might ask "What is the capital of Indiana?". Each button should have a data-answer attribute that lists the answer.

When a button is clicked, display the answer to the button's question in a div. Use only one function, and that function must make use of the button's data-attribute.
